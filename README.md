# Mechatronics-Pant-Machine
Project for NTNU course TMM4150 - Machine Design and Mechatronics

### Components:
+ Arduino Uno
+ Pushbutton
+ Hall Effect Sensor
+ TFT 1.8" display
+ Seedstudio Grove Speaker

### To-Do list
- [x] Create sample codes for each component
- [ ] Merge sample codes together and create a first working code
- [ ] Think about what are we going to show on the display
- [ ] And what sound are we going to play with the speaker
- [ ] What happens with the inserted can? 
- [ ] Show our product on Mechatronics EXPO on 22nd of September :tada:
